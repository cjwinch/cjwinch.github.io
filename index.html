				<p>What is it that makes EESoc the best departmental society at Imperial? I'm sure you all have different answers, whatever they might be the people on the committee are responsible for making them happen! I want to listen to your voices and make EESoc everything you want it to be.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
As President of the EESoc I wish to maintain all the great things about EESoc, such as the great links with industry and our great social events. I will also work with the Department and Dep Rep to make sure you get the support you need to excel in your studies, in particular I would like to set up better welfare systems in the department. I would also like to organize activities with other departments and improve the buddies scheme for the freshers.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Having started and run the Kitesurfing society for two years I have learnt a lot about leadership and reaching out to people, attributes I think will be important as EESoc President. I have also been involved in CGCU as Events Officer and Swimming and Water-Polo as BUCS Captain and Tour Secretary. Through all of this I have learnt a lot about working with other people and how to organize events effectively and successfully.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Most importantly I want to listen to your ideas on how to improve EESoc and help create a society where we all get the most out of both the academic and the social side of studying EEE / EIE at Imperial!</p>

Hi! I'm Leon, I’m a 3rd Year EEE student, and I’d love to be your Vice-President for EESoc.

A department is nothing without its students, and so I want to ensure the EEE/EIE experience is the absolute best it can possibly be. After all, your happiness and satisfaction is what counts. I’m passionate about building upon the excellent work of the previous committee to take EESoc to even greater heights – and to make sure your EE experience isn’t just about transistors, lab reports, and questionable 6th Floor coffee. 





<div class="clear"></div>
I’m excited to provide you with an outstanding CarEErs Fair, diverse IndustrEE talks, and an exceptional Christmas Dinner. I want to ensure an unparalleled range of social events for you guys, and I want to ensure the Mums and Dads Scheme is as involved as possible. I’m determined to make sure our EE students have the opportunity to develop themselves professionally, academically and socially, and to the full extent of their potential. In short, I want to make sure EESoc is rightfully represented as one of the best departmental societies on campus, and one that our students are proud to be part of.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
I’m both passionate and dedicated, and have plenty of past experience in leadership roles. I’ve been heavily involved with EESoc in my 3 years here, and if that wasn’t enough, I have more eye-wateringly bad EE jokes than you can shake a soldering iron at.</p></div>

I have gained experience managing society budgets and got accustomed to the Union’s procedures as treasurer and president of the Portuguese Society. Being treasurer of EESoc is definitely a step up in terms of responsibilities and I will give the best of myself to ensure that our department’s funds are spent on events and activities that matter and will make your life as a student here even more worth it.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
I am an organised, social and very approachable person, I know the department well and am very enthusiastic about contributing and leaving a positive mark.

My name is Yuchen, current 3rd year EEE student, this year's CGCU VP for Finance and Societies, and e.quinox vice-chair.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
With the scale and diversity in terms of events this year, EESoc has already set a pretty high bar for next year. It is my goal to go beyond what was done this year and have an even bigger variety of activities. What about a Christmas dinner on the Thames? Track days at Daytona? I also want to be given the opportunity to show Imperial or even other London universities why we are the best. We will hold the best quiz nights, bar nights, sports tournaments and poker tournaments for which anyone can attend.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
As this year’s CGCU VP, I’ve helped to organise various high profile events and built many contacts within and outside of college. It is my intention to use experience and connections from my previous roles to organise cheap, fun events for you without bankrupting the society or you! Say you want to go karting at Daytona, I can liaise with CGCU Motor to organise track days with customised karts that go up to 60MPH, and at a cheaper price.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Given my past experience in various positions of responsibility around campus, you can trust me to organise high quality events next year.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Vote for me because I want to have lots of fun next year. Don’t you?</p>

I want to continue the fantastic work of this year's committee by maintaining and strengthening the department's excellent links with industry. 
<div class="clear"></div><br>
I am hard working and have a wealth of experience from two years on the RAG committee, holding positions of both Vice-Chair and Sponsorship Officer. I truly believe that EEE and EIE students are among the most employable graduates in the country, and I want to us to have exposure to the best companies around, across a range of industries. 
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Elect me and expect:
- Interesting talks and exciting events from the companies you're interested in. 
- More opportunities and assistance in finding graduate jobs, internships and six month industrial placements for third year. 
- Better links with professional engineering institutions. 
- New connections with companies from alternative industries, like Law, to expose students to the wide variety of options we have, alongside the current links with Engineering, Finance and Consultancy firms.

Vote Chris Winchurch for EESoc Industrial Liaison Officer to open doors to the careers we deserve!</p></div>

Though it is students led, the committee is given a lot of support by the department and by our external sponsors.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
Companies are only interested in providing us with their time, expertise, and money if they believe that the students in the department have something to offer them.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
This is where the industrial liaisons officers come in. We are ambassadors for the department who can are there to maintain links with our current partners and forge new ones, by showcasing the abilities of those in our department.
<div class="clear"></div><br>
If elected my goals would be:<ul>
<li>- To continue the weekly presentations from companies like BP, TFL and Detica.<li>
<li>- To bring in even more, exciting and interesting, companies to the already brilliant CarEErs fair.</li>
<li>- To improve the number of companies offering 6 month placements to third years.</li>
<li>- To help students in all years to get contacts within companies that they are interested in.</li></ul>

I believe that I am one of the correct people for this job for the following reasons:<ul>
- I have had summer work in industry since first year through the Power academy scheme which is supported by many companies of interest.


<li>- Talking with company reps at events has already given me links to people in industry.</li>
<li>- Having so far been unsuccessful in finding a 6 month placement I am able to help people avoid the mistakes I have made.</li></ul>
